# Limitations — what is a TRUE limit vs what is a BUG

**The bar (the mission):** any non-native code — pure Elixir/Erlang bytecode — runs on WasmGC,
bit-exact vs the VM. **If pure code doesn't run, that is a bug**, and we build the support.
This document is the canonical line between the two. Everything in §3 is a bug with a finite,
enumerated inventory; only §1 contains legitimate "can't"s, and even most of those have designed
answers.

Evidence base (all bit-exact vs the VM, one command: `elixir verify.exs`):
conformance **198/198** · fuzz **33/33** · gaps **20/20 provably correct** · API scoreboard
**389/389 (100%)** of all 392 public functions of ten stdlib modules (3 remaining are
`@nondet` — random/shuffle, where equality is not defined) · **genfuzz** (generative random
programs over the full term algebra) · **regexdiff** (the regex-shim corpus: 76 cases, 0 lies)
· real unmodified Jason 1.4.5 + Earmark 1.4.49 byte-identical (`demo/markdown`) · File/IO
effects 3/3 (`demo/effects`).

## 1. True limits (the only legitimate "reasons it can't")

### 1.1 Native code itself — the NIF/BIF host boundary
NIFs and C-implemented BIFs are, by definition, not "non-native code." Each one used must be
**shimmed at the host boundary** with equivalent semantics. The *limit* is therefore not "it doesn't
run" but **shim existence + semantic fidelity**:

- **`:re` (PCRE)** ↔ JS `RegExp`: the shim boundary is now a MEASURED line — `regexdiff/run.exs`
  diffs a 76-case corpus (patterns × subjects × the full Regex API) against real PCRE2, with every
  case classified: **68 exact** (incl. `$`-before-final-newline, `\Z`/`\z`, split semantics with
  parts/include_captures/empty patterns, lookbehind, backrefs, x-mode, named captures both
  syntaxes), **4 documented deltas** (PCRE byte-mode without `/u` on non-ASCII subjects; atomic
  `(?>` when its content must refuse to backtrack; branch-reset `(?|` capture numbering on a
  later alternative), and **4 honest refusals** (possessive quantifiers, recursion `(?R)`,
  subroutines `(?1)`, `\K`/`\G` — the shim THROWS rather than mismatching; `\K` would otherwise
  silently match a literal K in JS). Zero unclassified divergences. Fidelity endgame, if ever
  needed: compile PCRE2 itself to wasm as a linear-memory sidecar (the "no C" decision was about
  the *runtime term model*, not leaf libraries), or implement a PCRE-compatible engine in Elixir.
- **Float→string formatting** (`float_to_binary` et al.): Erlang uses shortest-round-trip (Ryu).
  JS also prints shortest-round-trip but with different formatting conventions at the edges
  (exponent thresholds, `1.0e20` vs `100000000000000000000`). Needs an exact-Erlang-format
  implementation, not a naive host passthrough. Buildable; precision-critical.
- **Unicode case/normalization**: currently host-shimmed (JS `toUpperCase`). The *pure* path
  exists — Elixir's own `String.Unicode` is generated Elixir code and already compiles — at a
  module-size cost. NFC/NFD normalization (`:unicode.characters_to_nf*`) likewise has table-driven
  pure implementations available.
- **`:crypto`**: host WebCrypto/node-crypto (shipped for hash). Limit = algorithm availability on
  the platform.
- **Time, randomness, entropy** (`:os.system_time`, seeds): host effects by nature; shimmed.
  (Note `:rand` itself is pure Erlang — only the seed is an effect.)

### 1.2 Effects are the host's — IO is handed back at the boundary
File, network, and OS effects are **not** a language limit: they lower to host imports, exactly like
NIFs. The compiled code calls `host.*`; **the host decides what backs it**:
- On a Node host: the real filesystem, real sockets.
- On Workers: a **virtual filesystem** (in-memory, or durable over KV/R2/DO storage) and
  fetch-backed networking — both legitimate, both already the model used for `http.get`/`:crypto`
  in the Req demo.
- A host that provides nothing for an effect leaves an **honest trap**, never a wrong value.

So `File.read/1` works wherever the host wires it. The only true limits here are what the host
*platform* can physically provide (no raw sockets on Workers — fetch only; no subprocesses/ports)
and the hard caps (~128MB isolate, ~10MB module — why function-level DCE exists). Defining the
effects ABI (`File.*` → host fs imports, `IO.*` → console/stream imports) is **bug-inventory work
(§3), not a limit**.

### 1.3 Runtime code creation
`Code.eval_string`, runtime `Module.create`, `EEx.eval_string/eval_file` require compiling code at
runtime — the platform forbids runtime wasm codegen. **The designed answer exists**: the tiered
runtime (`interp/` — a BEAM interpreter, itself compiled by this compiler, that executes `.beam`
as *data* with the same term ABI). Seed built and verified; productionizing it is roadmap work, so
even this limit is "buildable, via the tier." (Compile-*time* EEx templates are just functions and
need nothing special.)

### 1.4 Scale & scheduling semantics
~15–25k concurrent JSPI processes per isolate (vs BEAM's millions); the reduction budget is
per-isolate today (per-process budgets are roadmap); one isolate = one thread (parallelism comes
from many isolates/DOs, like BEAM distribution). These change *capacity*, not correctness.

**The body-recursion stack cliff** (measured): deep non-tail recursion overflows V8's default
~1MB stack at ~10⁴ frames (the VM handles millions; JSPI stacks do NOT help — same limit,
measured). Node-side mitigation SHIPPED: `runtime/deepstack.mjs` runs an export in a worker
thread with `resourceLimits.stackSizeMb` — at 256MB, **5,000,000 frames verified**. On workerd
the stack is platform-fixed, so the cliff stands there (~10⁴); the forward fix is compiler-level
trampolining of body recursion (roadmap). Note `--stack-size` beyond the actual OS thread stack
segfaults rather than raising — use the worker mitigation, not the flag.

---

## 2. Deliberate, documented deltas (not bugs — by decision)

- **Map iteration order for >32-key maps** is key-sorted (BST), not BEAM's HAMT hash order. Elixir
  documents map order as unspecified; BEAM's order isn't stable across OTP versions. Programs that
  depend on it are relying on unspecified behavior (this was the one apparent "compiler lie" in the
  gap corpus — a test bug; see `gaps/FINDINGS.md`).
- **Stacktraces are empty** (`__STACKTRACE__` = `[]`). Exceptions/try/rescue work; traces aren't
  recorded. Could be partially built (function names exist in `-g` builds); fidelity to BEAM trace
  format is a future decision, not promised.
- **`apply/3` reaches only compiled-in code** (closed world + DCE). Mitigated by apply-target
  analysis keeping reachable dispatch targets; fully recovered by the interpreter tier.
- **No live introspection** (`:observer`, `:dbg`, hot tracing) — closed-world consequence.

## 3. The bug inventory (buildable; "it's a lot of work" is not a reason)

Current enumerated inventory, classified by the kind of work. Tags: **[beams]** = pure code that
should run once the right `.beam`s are fed/kept (+ verify bit-exact); **[builtin]** = implement a
WAT builtin / host shim; **[compiler]** = compiler lowering work; **[exact]** = must match a
documented algorithm bit-for-bit; **[proc]** = scheduler-mode completion; **[interp]** = needs the
interpreter tier.

**Exceptions & errors (in every program's error paths; top of the gap-corpus frequency list):**
- `erlang:error/1,2,3`, `throw/1`, `nif_error/1` → lower to the `$exc` throw with proper terms **[compiler]**
- Exception constructors (`ArgumentError.exception/1`, `RuntimeError`, `KeyError`, …) — generated
  pure code **[beams]**; `Exception.message/normalize` **[beams]**
- `Kernel.inspect/1` + the `Inspect` protocol/Algebra — pure **[beams]**, plus `io_lib.*` (pure
  Erlang) **[beams]** and float formatting **[exact]**

**Term primitives:**
- `erts_internal.cmp_term/2` → wire to the existing `$term_compare` **[builtin]** (trivial)
- `erlang.phash/2`, `phash2` → documented stable algorithm, implement exactly **[exact]**
- `integer_to_binary/2`, `integer_to_list/2` (base-N; mirrors the just-built `binary_to_integer/2`),
  `atom_to_list/1`, `binary.last/1`, `list_to_bin/1` **[builtin]**
- `binary_to_float/1`, `list_to_float/1`, `float_to_binary/2`, `Float.round/3` **[exact]**
- Non-byte-aligned bitstrings (sub-byte segments; `gaps/` p18) **[compiler]**

**Dynamic atoms** (`binary_to_atom/2`, `*_to_existing_atom`, `Module.concat/1,2`): runtime
atom-table overflow — a name-keyed side table with interned identity **[compiler]**. Unlocks
unconsolidated-protocol dispatch too (though the right default is consolidating ourselves in our
closed-world pass — we have whole-program knowledge at compile time).

**Regex completion** (live frontier; run/2/3, split/3, replace/3 done):
`replace` with a **function** replacement (per-match closure dispatch back into wasm), `replace/4`,
`scan/2`, `match?/2`, `split/2`, `escape/1`, `compile!/1,2`, named captures **[builtin]**.

**Pure-Erlang/Elixir stdlib that should just run** **[beams]** (+ differential verification):
`:array`, `:orddict`, `:gb_trees`, `:queue`, `:digraph`, `:rand`, `erl_scan`/`erl_anno`,
leex/yecc-generated lexers (plain generated Erlang!), `Calendar`/`Date`/`DateTime`/`Time`
(`to_iso8601`), `Path.*`, `URI.*`, `OptionParser`, `String.Break`, `Stream`/`Stream.Reducers`,
`:sets`/`MapSet` internals, `Macro.*` (the pure parts), the `-inlined-` protocol/struct helpers.

**Process/runtime completion** **[proc]**: `spawn/1,3` + `spawn_monitor` in all call forms,
`erlang.send/2` alias forms, `make_ref/0` outside proc mode, `Process.get/delete/sleep`, `Task.*`,
runtime-variable `receive … after`, per-process reduction budgets, `unique_integer/0`.

**Host-effect ABI** **[builtin]** — hand IO back to the host (a virtual backend is fine):
- `File.*` → host fs imports (`fs_read`/`fs_write`/`fs_stat`/…): Node host = real fs; Workers host =
  virtual fs (in-memory or KV/R2/DO-backed); absent = honest trap.
- `IO.puts/warn/inspect` → host console/stream imports; `IO.stream` over host handles.
- `application.get_key/2` → static app env; `convert_time_unit` (pure arithmetic).

**RESOLVED (the Earmark campaign):** the LineScanner divergence was a real codegen bug —
`get_map_elements` destination/source register aliasing — now fixed; real Earmark renders
byte-identical (see `demo/markdown/`). The §3 inventory above has been largely BURNED DOWN: the
error/raise machinery, term primitives, full Regex surface, dynamic-atom lookups
(`*_to_existing_atom` over the closed-world table), float→text formatting, the effects ABI, the
OTP-27 map cursor, and sub-byte bitstring match/construct are all built and verified. The scoreboard
stands at **296/299 (99.0%)** with nine of ten modules perfect.

**BUILT — bitstring values (the final class):** a distinct `$bitstr` type (bytes + bit-length;
`is_binary(<<1::4>>)` correctly false), match contexts carry an end-bit, sub-byte `:binary`
extraction, bit-mode construction with dynamic sizes and bitstring-append, little-endian segments
both directions, and bitstring literals. `Float.round/ceil/floor` run the REAL IEEE
bit-decomposition (the old precision-0-only shim and its DCE bypass were deleted), and gaps p18's
10-bit packed protocol is provably correct. **The §3 inventory is now empty of known classes:**
gaps 20/20, scoreboard 299/299 (100.0%).

## 4. How we hold the bar (limitations as a *measured number*)

1. **Differential harnesses** — every change proves itself bit-exact vs the VM (conformance / fuzz /
   gaps), and every new real-library demo (Jason, Req, Earmark, …) extends the probe surface.
2. **The compiler never lies** — unsupported = a *counted trap* (`STUBS: N`, stub names listed),
   never a silently wrong value. 0 stubs ⇒ provably supported.
3. **LIVE: the stdlib API scoreboard** (`scoreboard/run.exs`, results in `scoreboard/SCOREBOARD.md`) —
   every public function of every roster module via `Module.__info__(:functions)`, concrete calls
   generated from a typed input pool, diffed Wasm vs VM through identical checksums. Current:
   **272/299 bit-exact (91.0%)** across 392 public functions of Enum/List/Map/Keyword/Tuple/Integer/
   String/Range/MapSet/Float (93 awaiting input-pool generation). The 27 failures independently
   re-derive §3's inventory: Float/Ryu formatting (7), Stream (3), dynamic atoms (2), `Map.pop`
   family (5), MapSet-v2 internals (2), unicode-normalize (1)… This document's §3 is now a
   **shrinking measured number per release** — the direct measurement of "any pure Elixir runs."
